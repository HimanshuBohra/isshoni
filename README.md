What is it
----------------
A chrome plugin for playing youtube videos in group session with friends. It can play music from Youtube in the background and keeps track of a playlist which is persisted to browser's local storage. Every member can add videos in the playlist or provide a link of a pre-created playlist and jam together.

What is next 
----------------
After completion of the first feature I will add voice chat feature. A light weight chrome extension which will be used to by friends and groups to chill and work together.
